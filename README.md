# Anylysis of an Election Audit Using Python:  is it successful and can it be automated

## Project and Purpose Overview
Determining the winner of any US election is a large task.  Information that is collected and evaluated include:

  •	i to lo
  •	i to lo

•	Total votes cast in the election
•	Total votes for each candidate
•	Percentage of the total vote each candidate received

The winner can be determined based on who received the largest percentage of the vote.  

Other useful information that migiht be collected and analysed from an election are:

•	Voter turnout for each county
•	Percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
•	County with the highest turnout

Historically this information has been analyzed in Excel.  While this is functional, there may be other options that can better handle large amounts of data and that can be automated and used for all future elections.  The purpse of this project is to determine if Python can be successfully used to generate the information needed to determine the winner of an election as well as generate the other useful information that is available from the election process. 


 





The purpose of this project is to audit an election for a Colorado US Congressional Precinct in Colorado using Python rather than Excel.  Information that is collected includes:
