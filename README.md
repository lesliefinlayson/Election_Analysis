# Anylysis of an Election Audit Using Python:  is it successful and can it be automated

## Project and Purpose Overview:
Determining the winner of any US election is a large task.  A great deal of information is collected and processed as quickly as possible.  A recent Colorade US Congressional Precinct, for example, had a turnout of almost 370,000 voters.  Historically this information is analyzed in Excel.  While this is functional, there may be other options that can better handle large amounts of data and that can be automated to save time and increase accuracy.  

The purpose of this project is to determine if Python can successfully generate the information needed to determine the winner of an election, generate other information that is useful to the Election Board, and can it be automated to be used by all types of elections in the future.  

## Election_Audit Results:

•	A total of 369,711 votes were cast in this election.  
To find the total votes of the election, a loop was written for each row in the CSV file provided amd a ;ome added tp tally the count:

 
 







In order to determine the election winner of the popular vote, s

The purpose of this project is to audit an election for a Colorado US Congressional Precinct in Colorado using Python rather than Excel.  Information that is collected includes:
Information that is collected and evaluated include:

•	Total votes cast in the election

•	Total votes for each candidate

•	Percentage of the total vote each candidate received

The winner can then be determined based on who received the largest percentage of the vote.  

Other useful information that migiht be collected and analysed from an election are:

•	Voter turnout for each county

•	Percentage of votes from each county out of the total count

•	County with the highest turnout
